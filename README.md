# RedditTwitterBot
Bot that mirrors memes from my favorite subreddits and posts them on Twitter.

<p>This is a Java bot I created using JRAW and Twitter4j libraries.</p> 
<p>The bot looks for popular posts r/me_irl and r/WholesomeMemes and other subreddits and tweets them out its Twitter account @snoobird_bot.<p>
